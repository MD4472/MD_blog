                  This is my first time to create a blog.  It's exhausting and rewarding to acquire the knowledge that we need to learn.  Let the journey continue.

                There is a ton of work to do in such little time.  The resources are out there but it's difficult to access quick answers when you need them.  We need a ton of caffeine, nutritious food, and liquor (just teasing!) to get us through the next six months or so.   Carry on mates!   We can do this.
                </p>


                <p>
                  I will write more later.  Hugs to all and good luck with the coding.

                  <p>Oh my goodness!  There is a ton to take in right now.   HTML and CSS are very useful however I don't know if this part of the program is the most interesting to me.  We shall see.  Rutgers has been great thus far.   Support, staff, and instructors want to see us succeed.   For this I am grateful.
                  We need the following:
                  <br></br>
                  1. Great resources to consult when needed.
                  <br></br>
                  2. Nutritious food and caffeine when necessary.  Other stimulants would not help in productivity - my opinion only.
                  <br></br>
                  3.  Frequent breaks.  There's going to be a lot of work, so rest will be important.
                  <br></br>
                  4.  Exercise and quality sleep.
                  <br></br>
                  5.  When possible try to engage in all sorts of activity that have a high fun factor.   Why not?  Laughter is just....awesome!
